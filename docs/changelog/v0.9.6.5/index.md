### Improvements

* Ninja Bot now supports sharding! This basically means more resources per server.

* `quote`, `gulag`, `messagecount`, `spellcheck` can be targeted using a mention, nickname, username, or id

* `poll` should be much more intuitive to use

* Images generated by Ninja Bot are stored on its own CDN

* Gulag picture is round and higher quality

* Names and role mentions can now be used to register roles as joinable or default in `settings`

* Major work done on the backend to support the API and future scaling

### Bugfixes

* Author profile pictures on the starboard are no longer blank after a user changes their picture

* Misc improvements to music features

* Loading a new emoji for the first time in a new channel no longer causes Ninja Bot to Freeze

* Fix some locale issues with schedule

### Regressions

* The 'Is Ajax Masters? (@Ajaxbeat)' account on twitter was blocked, so this feature no longer works :/
* Removed `letmein`
* Removed `line`
* Removed `spectrum`
